# DESCRIPTION:

We went to the First Robotics Competition, a world competition. We finished on the 1st position among 50 teams from Canada, the USA, Mexico, Australia, China, Poland at Montreal.
We got qualified for the world championship in the US.

I had to teach teenagers how to use a microcontroller and how to program in C++.

We built a robot with an autonomous period (based on visual recognition) and piloting by a joystick
Meeting every week, a week-long trip in Montreal and another in the US.

I was in charge of the visual recognition. You have access to the code here: \Visual-recognition\5553_2017\src\Robot.cpp
As it was 2-3 years ago my algorithmic skill was not great, it was mainly if-else and I was in charge of many other things on the robot, plus we only had 6 weeks to build it!
I had to recognize reflective ribbons to go straight until them, put an object on a pic and then go back home. You can see the result in match in the folder: Video_result
We are the team 5553
